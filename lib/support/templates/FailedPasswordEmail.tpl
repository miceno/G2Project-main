Warning!  There have been too many failed attempts to log in to the support/upgrade section of your Gallery2 installation using a password.  Password access to those parts of your Gallery2 has been disabled.

Your Gallery2 is still secure!  But now if you want to log in, you will have to pass a more advanced security check which is less convenient but much harder to hack.  Once you have logged in once that way, we will reinstate password access.

If you are the one who entered the wrong passwords, then do not worry about this.  Just follow the new instructions provided in the support or upgrade sections of your site.  If it was NOT you, then it is possible that somebody is trying to hack your Gallery2 installation so you should consult your system administrator for help!
